### 1. Project Setup
- **Initialize a Project Directory**: Create a directory for your project, including subdirectories for source code, tests, and documentation.
- **Version Control**: Initialize a git repository to manage versions and changes in your project.
- **Virtual Environment**: Set up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies. Use `venv` or `conda` to create an isolated environment for your project.

### 2. Select Libraries
- **Image Handling**: Choose a library for handling RAW images. `rawpy` is commonly used for reading and processing RAW files in Python.
- **Image Compression**: Decide on the compression algorithm. Options include traditional algorithms like JPEG or more advanced ones like JPEG 2000 or HEIF. Libraries such as `Pillow` or `imageio` can handle various image formats and compressions.
- **Performance Optimization**: For heavy lifting, consider using `NumPy` for numerical operations and `Cython` or `Numba` for speed optimizations.

### 3. Design the Application
- **Architecture Design**: Plan the architecture of your application. This could be a simple command-line tool, a web application, or a desktop application. For a CLI tool, consider using `argparse` or `click` for argument parsing.
- **Compression Algorithm Selection**: Offer options for different compression algorithms and parameters. This provides flexibility in balancing between compression rate and image quality.

### 4. Development
- **Reading RAW Images**: Implement functionality to read RAW image files using `rawpy` or another chosen library.
- **Image Processing and Compression**: Develop the core functionality to process and compress the images. This should include converting RAW images to a format that can be easily compressed, applying the compression, and saving the compressed image.
- **User Interface**: Create a user interface, whether CLI, GUI, or web-based. For a CLI, implement argument parsing for input files, compression options, and output paths.
- **Testing**: Write tests for your code using `pytest` or `unittest`. Ensure your tests cover various scenarios, including different image sizes, formats, and compression settings.

### 5. Optimization and Testing
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the performance of your application by profiling with tools like `cProfile` and making necessary adjustments.
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test your application on different operating systems to ensure compatibility.

### 6. Deployment
- **Packaging**: Package your application for distribution. If it's a CLI tool, you could distribute it via PyPI. For web applications, deploy to a server or cloud platform.
- **Documentation**: Write comprehensive documentation, including how to install, configure, and use your application. Include examples and possible troubleshooting tips.

### 7. Maintenance
- **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for your application releases.
- **Community Engagement**: If your project is open-source, engage with the community for feedback, bug reports, and contributions.
